# Django REST Framework Project

This project is a simple starter setup using **Django** and **Django REST Framework** (DRF). It is designed to help you quickly build APIs using Django.

## Introduction to Django REST Framework

[Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It allows you to:

- Serialize Django models into JSON or other content types
- Handle API requests with views and viewsets
- Easily implement authentication and permissions
- Paginate and filter query results
- Build RESTful APIs quickly

DRF is widely used in production for creating backend APIs that serve mobile apps, front-end frameworks like React, and other web services.
